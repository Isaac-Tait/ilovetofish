          I have been following the bait finesse scene more closely
          over the last few months. I have never lived somewhere like
          Connecticut with such a plethora of lakes and so my spin rod

          . For the past few months I have been using my trusty old
          Diawa spin rod but then one day I picked it up and the reel
          had completely seized up. It had been running pretty rough
          even after a full tear down, cleaning, and re-lube - so, I
          decided it was time for a new reel.

          I decided to see what all the hype was and purchased a
          KastKing Zephyr BFS reel. I took it out to practice at a
          beautiful lake about 25 minutes from my home. I quickly
          realized how much I had to learn. I spent most of the time
          untangling birds nests. Slowly but surely though I started
          to get the hang of it. The next day I jumped into the
          &quot;deep-end&quot; so to speak and headed out to check out
          some new water I had been eyeballing on Google Maps.

          I love fishing harder to access water. The less roads a
          river has near it or crossing it the better. I do not mind
          hiking several miles just to access low pressure water to
          fish for wild (or maybe even native) trout.

          When I arrived I almost got back in my truck and left. The
          water was very thin, which I found very surprising as it had
          quite a few streams that converged in the headwaters to form
          this river. Reluctantly I decided to at least check it out
          for five or ten minutes. Just out of sight of the road I
          came across a HUGE pool that was in spots chest deep and
          several hundred feet long!

          After the pool the brook thinned out again and I almost
          turned around but I could not shake the notion that maybe
          there was some more great pools higher up. So, I pressed on.

          After a bit of hiking upstream I came across exquisite small
          pool after exquisite small pool. It took quite a few casts
          to get my aim right but at each pool I caught or almost
          caught the most vibrant, spunky, beautiful wild Brook Trout

          I was glad that I had decided to press on both times. This
          creek was full of surprises. I saw numerous frogs, crawfish,
          and there were several hawks. Not to mention the epic dragon
          fly spectacle as I egressed back to my truck.

          Down lower the brook was less constrained by trees, bushes,
          and foliage. However, as I pressed on upstream the sides of
          the river got closer and closer. Then around a bend I came
          upon &quot;walls&quot; of Mountain Laurel growing on both
          sides of the river and over it!

          It was an absolutely surreal day. I came across a few deer
          hunter camps too but they looked pretty ragged. I do not
          think they have been used for a few seasons... At my high
          point I found a nice flat rock next to the water and had a
          late lunch of canned dolmas, trail mix, and hot miso soup. I
          love it here in Connecticut between the skiing in the winter
          and fishing in the spring, summer, and fall I do not think I
          will ever leave...
