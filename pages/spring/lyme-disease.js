            it was land leaches.
          </Link>
          Honestly though I would take land leaches any day because at least when they bit you you
          were not at risk of contracting a horrific disease.

          Earlier this week I visited a new section of a river that I have visited many times. It is
          less than thirty minutes from my home and even when the water is very low the fishing is
          always epic. The stream run cold and clear even in the midst of a drought and despite the
          very low flow the river has some huge pools. I caught and released several fish that day
          including a fourteen inch Brown Trout that put up quite a fight.

          When I got home though I discoverd two very tiny ticks embedded in my leg. These things
          were seriously tiny about the size of a poppy seed. So, the next day I went out and bought
          a bottle of Pemetherin.{' '}

            I hate chemicals
          </Link>
          &nbsp;but if I have to choose between short term exposure to harmful chemicals and the
          possibility of a lifetime of debilitating illness, well I guess I will have to take my
          chances with the chemicals.

          I did not spray the Permetherin on my fishing clothing though - just my yard work and
          hiking clothing. I cannot stand the thought of poisoning the river as I practice
          exclusively wet wading (even in the shoulder season when the water is &gt; 50 degrees).
          So, instead now I have implemented a few new practices when I am done fishing. First, I
          have a change of clothes in the truck and I change out of my fishing clothes as soon as I
          am finished fishing. In the past I used to drive home and change, but that is just no
          longer a safe option.

          Secondly, I spray myself down with an organic essential oil anti-tick spray after I change
          into fresh clothes. Lastly, when I get home I take my fishing clothes out of the bed of my
          truck{' '}

            and dry them on high for at least twenty minutes
          </Link>
          &nbsp;before washing them on hot and then drying them on hot again. It seems a little
          excessive but I have found ticks in our washing machine that have survived a hot wash. I
          love New England, I think it is a nearly perfect place to live but the ticks this year
          have been SOO bad.

          A random side note Dryad Saddle mushrooms are in season right now and they are popping up
          all over. These mushrooms are pretty cool because they can be used to make paper. I wonder
          how anyone figured that one out...
