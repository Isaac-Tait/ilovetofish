          A few weeks back my family and I flew out to California to
          visit friends and family for two weeks. When we came home
          Connecticut was experiencing a second summer. In fact it was
          warmer in Connecticut than it had been when we left Southern
          California! I took advantage of the second summer weather
          and headed out to find some trout on a few small blue lines.
          One was a new area and the other area I had been to a
          handful of times over the past{' '}

          When I pulled up to the trail-head on Monday the lot was
          nearly full (well three cars had parked in such a way as to
          fill up a six car lot) so, I squeezed in between a few trees
          with my truck and doused myself in tick spray and headed off
          into the woods in search of some trout.

          I checked the water temperature with my new Apple Ultra
          watch and it came in at 63 degrees. I saw numerous fish but
          was having zero luck enticing any to chomp my lure until I
          came across a really nice pool. As I retrieved my lure
          beside a half submerged log a lovely Brookie ducked out of
          the cover and slammed my lure. I brought her to hand and
          quickly released her back into the cool water.

          It was to be the first and last fish of the day, which was
          fine by me. It was actually kind of hot in the sun as I had
          dressed for cooler temperatures. I kept my eyes peeled for
          mushrooms on the way back but did not really see any - just
          a pheasant hunter way off in the woods. It was a reminder
          that we were in the thick of hunting season and that I
          should probably start wearing my flash orange gear while
          hiking to and from the river so as not to be mistaken for
          something somebody wants for the freezer in their garage...

          My second day out fishing came a little later in the week.
          While it was not 77 degrees it was still fairly warm in the
          50&#39;s. A quick check of the water temperature though with
          my Apple Ultra watch showed the water to be 48 degrees! My
          legs went numb quickly as I waded into the water with my
          Japanese sawanobori gear (read wet wading - waders are for
          wimps).

          A lovely section that had proven to be productive during my

          This river brushed up against several homes but during the
          spring/summer you could not see the homes. This time though
          with no foliage I was on full display as I fished up stream.
          At one point two guys came out on their porch to watch me
          fish. I prefer more private fishing experiences so I did not
          stick around too long and kept pressing on upstream.

          A choice spot down low on the river on day one..

        <p className='mb-1'>
          I was seeing a lot of fish in the river and even had several
          that chased my lure but no takers. I was starting to think
          that the river was just too cold to elicit much action until
          I came to a really nice spot higher up the river than I had
          ever been before.

          I came around a bend and before me lay one of the best
          sections of river I have seen in a long time. The bank was
          littered with boulders creating the most exquisite trout
          habitat. There was an ancient tree that provided a huge
          boscage of roots for fish to hide under at the deepest part
          of the pool. As I stepped closer I spooked a rather large
          trout in the shallowest tail waters of the pool. I knew my
          chances were blown, I was not expecting a trout to be in
          such thin water - but I guess I should have though since the
          water was so darn cold...

          Another nice spot
        </p>
        <p>
          I was not totally skunked though. A few feet above this
          amazing pool was another striking run. I cast my lure into
          the calm pool on the far side of a riffle run and retrieved
          it through the fast moving water. I had a hit but I missed
          the set. I tried again and got another hit but I missed the
          set. This happened a third time and a fourth and a fifth. On
          the fifth hit I set the hook and brought to hand a beautiful
          Brook Trout. I was beyond elated. I could almost see the
          road where I had planned to stop fishing that day and I
          really wanted to finish out 2022 with a proper fish. This
          one was a proper native Brookie. I packed up my rod and
          headed back to the truck. It was slow going though, my legs
          were so numb my ankles did not really want to flex. I
          eventually made it back to my truck walking along some quiet
          country roads. I must have been quite the spectacle though
          wearing my Japanese fishing getup as I was getting a lot of
          stares from passing motorists.
