          With the drier season fast approaching and the rivers getting smaller and smaller I was
          beginning to feel guilty for continuing to put pressure on the fish in the rapidly
          dwindling and warming water. I began considering switching to lake fishing for the summer.

          So, I decided to purchase a kayak. I started doing some research on fishing kayaks and was
          surprised at how much they cost. I kept my eyes on Craiglist but I did not see anything
          that caught my eye until late one night I came across a Heritage Featherlite 9.5 for sale.
          The price was a little high so I messaged them to see if they would take a lower price.
          They agreed! The next day I drove down and picked her up.

          It was a good thing though that they came down on the price. On our maiden voyage she was
          taking on water. I did not notice right away though, until I was in the middle of the
          lake. Thankfully I was able to make it to shore.

        <p className="flex justify-center text-xs italic">A hole in the hull...</p>
        <p>
          The hole was about four inches long. I loaded the kayak back up in the truck and drove
          eight minutes to the local hardware store and bought some 100 grit sand paper, epoxy
          resin, and a role of Gorilla patch and seal tape. The epoxy said it would set in 15
          minutes and cure in 24 hours. I did not want to wait 24 hours - that is why I bought the
          tape - to seal the hole while the epoxy dried.

          I cleaned up the area around the hole with a sanitizing wipe, then sanded the area around
          the hole to ensure the tape had a &quot;better&quot; surface to stick to. Then I wiped
          down the area with a wet napkin (to clean up the dust from sanding) and applied the epoxy.
          While I waited for the epoxy to set I made lunch on my camp stove.

          After lunch I applied the Gorilla tape and put the kayak back into the water. The patch
          job held! I was back in business. For my maiden voyage I wanted to explore a river I had
          recently found. I could only access the upper section of the river on foot though...

          The lower section was &quot;protected&quot; by homes and a plethora of No Trespassing
          signs. However, there was no one stopping me from gaining access to this river at the
          point where it flowed into another much larger river. I just had to get up that much
          larger river. Enter my kayak...

          After repairing my kayak I began making my way up the said larger river. I stopped to fish
          along the way in a few promising spots. I had a fish or two on for a bit but they got
          away. There were two other kayakers on the river, but they were just sunbathing and not
          really interested in my &quot;under the radar&quot; operation to access the lower section
          of the river that I had tried unsuccessfully to reach a few weeks ago.

          Once I made it to the point where the two rivers converge I navigated through a delta
          teaming with millions of baby fish. I was able to get my kayak through in areas where the
          water was only three to four inches deep. However, there were a few spots where I had to
          get out and pull my kayak behind me.

          I found a good spot to stash my kayak and I continued upstream on foot. After clearing a
          massive log jam I entered the forest and was immediately greeted by a lovely stream. It
          had shrunk considerably since I had last fished it. I ended up putting away my spin rod
          and using my tenkara rod instead. It was perfect medium gradient pocket water with lots of
          rocks.

          At one pool I came within a few feet of mink sitting on a mossy boulder eating a mouse. He
          seemed surprised to see me - I doubt many people come from the direction I came from. I
          watched him scamper away with his mouse in his mouth and continued upstream. I caught a
          small Fallfish and saw some larger ones at the bottom of a deep pool.

          I really hope we get some rain soon. Our last good storm was almost two weeks ago now. The
          rivers are all looking pretty sparse. I did go on another kayaking trip a few days later
          and my patch job held up strong. No fish caught on the second trip though - although in my
          defense I did not get on the water until 10:30 on our first day of the summer to hit the
          90 degree mark. Some of the photos are from that second trip.

          I have a few kinks to work out in my system. I have never fished from a kayak before.
          There are some challenges that I just have to work at to overcome. I will say that I am
          little bummed because I had read that you could stand and fish in my kayak. That does not
          seem to be the case. She gets quite squirrelly if I stand up. I kept thinking I was not
          doing it right but after the fourth or fifth time almost capsizing I decided you really
          cannot stand up in my kayak...
